- "Operating System Concepts" by Silberschatz, Galvin, and Gagne.
- Parallel computing and distributed ML resources.

**Concept Understanding:**
- Process lifecycle, inter-process communication.
- Segmenting neural network models across processes.

#### **Part B: Thread-Based Parallel Data Processing**

**Objective:** Implement multithreading within each process for parallel data processing.

**Instructions:**
1. Create multiple threads for data loading and preprocessing.
2. Synchronize threads for shared resource management.
3. Facilitate thread communication within the process.

**Study Materials:**
- Concurrency and multithreading documentation.
- Machine learning data preprocessing techniques.

**Concept Understanding:**
- Thread lifecycle, synchronization (Locks, Events, Semaphores).
- Parallel data processing strategies in ML.

#### **Part C: Pipe-Based Model Communication**

**Objective:** Establish pipe-based communication for model weight and gradient exchange.

**Instructions:**
1. Set up pipes for inter-process communication.
2. Implement data sending and receiving functionality through pipes.
3. Manage the sequence of operations for data flow.

**Study Materials:**
- IPC and Pipes in Unix/Linux programming guides.

#### **Part D: Signal Handling for Synchronization and Control**

**Objective:** Use signals for process control and training synchronization.

**Instructions:**
1. Set up signal handlers in processes.
2. Define signals for various control actions (start/stop epoch, checkpointing).
3. Implement signal sending and receiving mechanism.

**Study Materials:**
- Signal handling in Unix/Linux (using the `signal` module in Python).
- Synchronization in distributed systems.

**Concept Understanding:**
- Types of signals, signal handling mechanisms.
- Signal-based control in distributed ML training.
